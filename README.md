# Cydia Manager
This is my second attempt on making a more functional
prototype for a pastebin version management system for updating and notifying
users.

## Compatiblity
Currently only,
      -CydiaScriptLoader

is compatible with this plugin.

### Future
Hopefully, developers will send a request on adding their plugins to
this program, so people can be notified easily on what plugins need to be updated
for quick patches and security patches to get to the users.
(basically allows your users to be notified on any update to plugins and possibly increase
update rate.)

# Not released?
Yes, this has not been released as a full build and on the plugin repository.
However, this plugin MAY get to the plugin repository if other people
wants their plugin in this system. Not all systems work properly, because I was
aiming for a quick concept and first build.
